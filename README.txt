I used the NXT 2.0 brick with the following parts (All of the following parts can be found on the Lego website, except the RGB color sensor, try Amazon):
NXT Package - 8547
Ultrasonic Sensor - 9846
RGB Color Sensor - 9694
3x Servo - 9842

I used the nxt-python (http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/) package in conjuncture with my Raspberry Pi, model B.

For the RaspberryPi's hardware I used a Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 and to power it I used an Instapark MP1800 U2.

Below are the ports used for the sensors:
Wheel Servos - Ports B,C
Camera Servo - Port A
Ultrasonic Sensor - Port 1
RGB Color Sensor - Port 4
